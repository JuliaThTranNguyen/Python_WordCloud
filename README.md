# This is an example of "Python - WordCloud"
## Author: T.H.JuliaRosy - TranHien
## Main language: Python
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. INTRODUCTION:
### In this step to step tutorial, we will learn/understand on how to create a simple WordCloud with Python.
### What if WordCloud: A word cloud is a collection, or cluster, of words depicted in different sizes. It is simply a better visualization technique to epresent the frequency of words in a text where the size of the word represents its frequency.
### In this tutorial, for some extra fancy coding styles, we will generate that WordCloud in to specific shape by using matplotlib library.


## 2.PREPARATION:
### To get ready for this tutorial, we need to have:
#### 1. A "png" or "ipg" file of Python logo
#### 2. A "txt" file - In this case I make a copy of Python from WIKiPEDIA
#### <cite source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>


## 3. CODING/PROGRAMMING "WORDCLOUD":
### 1. INSTALLING SOME NEEDED LIBRARIES:
        $ pip install numpy
        $ pip install pillow
        $ pip install matplotlib
        $ pip install wordcloud
  
  
#### SHORT EXPLANATION:
##### In order to work with wordclouds in python, we will first have to install a few libraries using pip. They are numpy (for array manipulation), 
##### pillow (for image handling), matplotlib (for generating plots) and finally wordcloud (for generating wordclouds).



### 2. CREATE FILE:
#### Create any file ends with ".py" to store the main code for this tutorial.
#### In this tutorial, I created the "main.py"



### 3. RUN/EXECUTE "main.py"
#### Run the file, check and alter the code in any different solutions.
#### As if in teh final result, the shape of wordcloud is not visually following the given image.
#### Please recheck the quality of the image, or the re-edit styles in "GEN_WORDCLOUD" - "main.py"
